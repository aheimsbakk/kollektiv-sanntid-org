# Kollektiv.Sanntid.org

Real-time public transport departure board for Norway. Track buses, trams, metro, trains, ferries, and coaches with live departure times from any station or stop across the country.

## About

This app uses [Entur's API](https://developer.entur.org/) to show live departures from Norwegian public transport. It's built with the [JourneyPlanner API](https://developer.entur.org/pages-journeyplanner-journeyplanner) and is the first app I've created using vibe coding.

## Getting Started

### Finding Your Station

There are two ways to pick a station:

**By name** — click the **⚙️ settings** button in the top right, type in the **Station or stop name** field, and select from the dropdown suggestions.

**By location** — click the **🧭 compass** button in the top left. The app asks for your location and instantly lists the nearest stops with their distance and transport modes. Click any result to load it.

Once a station is loaded, choose which transport types you want to see, then click **Close** to apply.

To save the station to your favorites, click the **🩶 heart button** to the left of the station name. The heart is gray when a station is not saved. Once saved, the heart turns red ❤️ — and remains **clickable**. Click it again to **remove** the station from your favorites.

### Using Favorites

Click the **station name** at the top of the screen to open your favorites list. This shows your recently viewed stations with their transport filters. Click any favorite to instantly switch to that station.

Your favorites list stores up to 8 stations with all their settings. The most recently used station appears at the top.

To remove a station from favorites, click the red heart ❤️ on the departure board while viewing that station — it will be removed immediately.

If you have no favorites yet, the app pre-seeds **Jernbanetorget, Oslo** as a starting point so the board is never empty on first use.

### Sharing Your Board

Click the **📋 share** button (next to the theme toggle) to copy a shareable link to your clipboard. This link includes:

- Your current station
- Selected transport modes

When someone opens your link, the station is automatically added to their favorites.

## Features

### GPS Nearby Stops

Click the **🧭 compass** button in the top left to find stops near your current location:

- The app requests your device's GPS position (one-time, no tracking)
- Lists up to **8 nearest stops** within a **2 km radius**
- Each result shows the stop name, distance in metres, and transport mode icons
- Click any stop to load it immediately — then use the ❤️ heart to save it

The dropdown closes automatically when you select a stop or press **Escape**.

### Loading More Departures

Scroll down past the last departure to progressively load more:

- **Touch/mouse drag** — pull upward from the bottom of the departure list; a ▼ indicator bounces to confirm the gesture is registered. Release to load.
- **Mouse wheel** — scroll down at the bottom of the list until the threshold is reached; loads automatically.

Departures load in steps: **1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 13 → 21**. When the maximum (21) is reached, the indicator switches to ● and a short hint suggests using ⚙️ settings to change the default number of departures.

The extra departures are temporary — the count resets when you switch station, apply settings, or reload the app.

### Live Departures

The app displays upcoming departures with:

- **Line number and destination** for each service (e.g., "Ski ● L2 🚅")
- **Realtime indicators** - ● solid dot for live tracking, ○ hollow dot for scheduled times; 🔴 **red solid dot** when a live-tracked departure is running late (aimed time earlier than expected time)
- **Platform/gate information** - Shows platforms (⚏10), gates (◆A), or stops (▪B) where available
- **Countdown timer** showing minutes until departure
- **Transport icons** (🚌 🚋 🚇 🚅 🛳️ 🚍) to identify the vehicle type
- **Delay indicator** - When live data shows a departure is running late, the solid dot turns **red** (●). This only appears when realtime tracking is active and the expected departure is later than the originally aimed time.
- **Cancellation notices** - Cancelled departures appear with strikethrough and reduced opacity
- **Automatic updates** every 60 seconds (configurable)
