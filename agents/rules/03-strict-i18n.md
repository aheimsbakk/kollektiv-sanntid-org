# Rule: Strict Internationalization (i18n)
Never hardcode user-facing text strings in JavaScript or HTML files. All user-facing text MUST use the project's translation system. Whenever you add a new translation key, you MUST immediately provide translations for ALL supported languages in the project configuration before completing the task.
