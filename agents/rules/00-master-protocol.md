# Rule: Master Protocol Alignment
Before beginning any task, proposing any changes, or creating documentation, you MUST check for the existence of project-specific agent protocols or contributor guidelines (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `BLUEPRINT.md`). 

1. If such a file exists, you MUST read it to internalize the project's specific workflows, constraints, and mandatory steps.
2. You are strictly forbidden from bypassing the workflows defined in the project's protocol file.
3. Treat the project's protocol file as the absolute source of truth for *how* you should operate within this specific repository.
