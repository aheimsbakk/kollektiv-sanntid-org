# Rule: Architectural Boundaries
Strictly respect the project's execution environment constraints. If the project is defined as "client-side only", do not propose, write, or require server-side code (like Node.js APIs) for core functionality. Restrict backend environments (like Node/Bun) strictly to local build scripts, tooling, and test runners.
