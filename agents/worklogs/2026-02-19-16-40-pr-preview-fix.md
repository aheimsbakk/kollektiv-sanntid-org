Redesigned PR preview system to use orphan `previews` branch. Main site deploys to root, PR previews to `/pr-N/` subfolders. Updated all three workflows: `static.yml` (main site), `pr-preview.yml` (PR deployments), `pr-preview-cleanup.yml` (cleanup). Added `scripts/init-previews-branch.sh` to initialize branch. Version bumped to 1.10.1.
