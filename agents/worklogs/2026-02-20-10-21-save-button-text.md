Changed save button text from "Save" to "Save to Favorites" (and equivalents in all 12 supported languages) in `src/i18n.js`. Makes button purpose clearer - it saves current station to favorites dropdown, not general settings. Translations updated for: English, Norwegian, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Farsi, Hindi, Icelandic, Ukrainian, French, Polish. Version bumped to 1.15.6.
