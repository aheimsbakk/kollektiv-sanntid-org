Replaced complex transit/clock icons with simpler design: large bold "S" letter centered in a circular green background (#72e0a1). Updated all three icon sizes: favicon.svg (32x32), icon-192.svg (192x192), and icon-512.svg (512x512). The "S" uses dark background color (#0b0f1a) with font-weight 900 for maximum boldness. Version bumped to 1.26.0.
