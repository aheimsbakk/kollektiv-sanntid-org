Simplified footer link text in `src/i18n.js` from translated "Star on GitHub" phrases to just "GitHub" across all 8 languages. This creates a cleaner, more universal appearance since "GitHub" is a brand name recognized globally. Footer now displays "Version X.X.X. GitHub" consistently in all languages. Bumped version to 1.5.2.
