why: The 5 new src/i18n/ modules were missing from the service worker asset cache, breaking offline support
what: Add i18n/ module paths to ASSETS list in sw.js
model: opencode/claude-sonnet-4-6
tags: [fix, sw, pwa, i18n, offline]

Added `./i18n/index.js`, `./i18n/translations.js`, `./i18n/languages.js`, `./i18n/detect.js`, and `./i18n/store.js` to the `ASSETS` array in `src/sw.js`. Without these entries the service worker install would succeed but the app would fail to load offline after the i18n refactor. Bumped to v1.31.5.
