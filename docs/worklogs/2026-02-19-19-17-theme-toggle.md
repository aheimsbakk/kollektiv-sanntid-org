Added theme toggle button (🌞/🌤️/🌥️) to header left of gear icon. Created `src/ui/theme-toggle.js` with light/auto/dark modes that cycle on click. Updated `src/app.js` to initialize theme and integrate toggle button, changed gear icon to ⚙️. Updated `src/style.css` with flexbox layout and hover effects for header controls. Removed obsolete `tests/data-loader.test.mjs`. Version bumped to 1.15.0.
