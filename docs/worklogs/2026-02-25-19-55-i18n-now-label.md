why: The "Now" countdown label was hardcoded in English; needed i18n support across all 12 languages.

Added `now` translation key to all 12 languages in `src/i18n.js`. Updated `formatCountdown` in `src/time.js` to accept an optional `translator` argument and return the localised "Now" string. Wired the `t` helper through `updateDepartureCountdown` in `src/ui/departure.js` and both call-sites in `src/app.js`. Version bumped to 1.30.4.
