Updated `README.md` with three corrections: (1) favorites capacity updated from 5 to 7, (2) default favorite pre-seed note added, (3) share link description trimmed to station + modes only, (4) "Finding Your Station" step 5 corrected from "Save to Favorites" to "Close", with a new sentence explaining the ❤️ heart button on the departure board as the way to save a station to favorites. No code changes; version remains 1.33.1.
