## Unified Dropdown Styles (v1.6.5)

Matched station dropdown styling to autocomplete dropdown for visual consistency. Changed station dropdown to use grid layout with 6px gaps, 6px padding, inverted colors on hover/select (white bg, dark text #081021), 8px item padding, 4px border-radius, and 0 6px 18px shadow. Both dropdowns now share identical visual treatment for better UX consistency.
