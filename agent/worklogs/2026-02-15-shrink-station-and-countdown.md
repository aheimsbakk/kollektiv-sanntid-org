Title: shrink station title and countdown (20%)

What: UI tweak to reduce station title text, countdown text and related icons by 20% across all text-size settings.

Why: requested change to visually reduce prominence of station and time elements while keeping layout consistent.

Files changed:
- src/style.css: adjusted countdown font-size multipliers and icon sizes; added station title font-size rule.

No behavior changes. Ran unit tests locally.
