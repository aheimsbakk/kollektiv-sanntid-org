Title: Reduce text-size scale values by 20%

What I changed:
- Adjusted CSS scale variables for text-size utility classes so each size is 20% smaller.

Files modified:
- src/style.css

Reasoning:
- The user requested slightly smaller typography for all predefined sizes. Reducing scale values by 20% keeps relative differences while lowering overall size.
