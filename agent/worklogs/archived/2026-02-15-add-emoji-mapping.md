Title: Add transport emoji mapping to departure nodes

What I will change:
- Add a small emoji element before the countdown in each departure node.
- Implement a UI-only heuristic to map transport mode tokens to emoji choices selected by the user.
- Add a unit test and small CSS for alignment.

Files to be modified:
- src/ui/departure.js
- src/style.css
- tests/ui.emoji.test.mjs
